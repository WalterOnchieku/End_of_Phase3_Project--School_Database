****End of Phase 3 Project****
***Primary School Database with SQLAlchemy***
This project is a primary school database management system built using SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library. It allows management of students, teachers, classes, subjects, scores, and grades in a relational database using Python.

*Project Overview*
This project simulates a school system where you can:

Manage student data (add, view).
Manage teacher data (add, view).
Track student performance via scores and calculate grades.
Organize subjects and associate them with teachers and students.
Handle class assignments for students and teachers.

Features
Student Management:

Add new students with information like name, date of birth, gender, and class.
View all students, their class assignments, and associated details.
Teacher Management:

Add new teachers with their respective subjects.
View all teachers and their subject specializations.
Class Assignments:

Each class is managed by a specific teacher and contains multiple students.
Subject & Score Management:

Subjects are taught by teachers and have associated student scores.
View individual student scores and the maximum possible score for a subject.
Grade Calculation:

Students' grades are calculated based on scores across subjects.
View calculated grades for each student.
Database Schema
The project uses a relational database schema with the following tables:

Students: Stores student information such as name, date of birth, gender, and the class they are assigned to.

Teachers: Stores teacher information and the subject they teach.

Classes: Contains information about the school classes and the teacher responsible for each class.

Subjects: Stores the list of subjects taught in the school.

Scores: Records the scores students achieved in each subject, along with the maximum score possible.

Grades: Contains the calculated grades of students based on their scores.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following:

Python 3.6 or higher
SQLAlchemy
SQLite (default database)

Installation
Clone the Repository:<git clone https://github.com/liza/school-database.git>
<cd school-database>
Install the required dependencies:
<pip install -r requirements.txt>
Database Setup:

The database is automatically created by SQLAlchemy when you run the project for the first time.

Run the Project:

You can run the CLI interface by executing:
<python cli.py>

Project Structure
cli.py: The command-line interface that presents a menu for performing actions on the school database.
helper.py: Contains the core logic for adding, viewing, and managing data within the database.
models.py: The SQLAlchemy models defining the database schema, including relationships between tables.
school.db: The SQLite database file, generated by SQLAlchemy.
Usage
Main Menu
Once you run python cli.py, you will be presented with the School Database Menu where you can choose from the following options:

View Students
Add Student
View Teachers
Add Teacher
View Student Grades
View Student Scores
Exit
Examples
Add a New Student:

Choose "Add Student" from the menu.
Provide the requested information, such as name, date of birth, and class ID.
View All Students:

Choose "View Students" from the menu.
The system will display all students with their assigned classes.
View Student Grades:

Select "View Student Grades" and provide the student's ID to display the calculated grades.
Data Representation
The system uses dictionaries, tuples, and lists to represent data:

Dictionary: Used to map student IDs to student data.
List of Tuples: Used to display student and teacher data with associated class and subject information.
Error Handling
Error handling is implemented to catch and handle various exceptions, ensuring smooth execution:

Invalid Input:

If the user enters an invalid input (e.g., a non-numeric student ID), an error message is displayed, and the program will prompt the user again.
Database Errors:

SQLAlchemy exceptions are caught, and appropriate messages are shown when database operations fail (e.g., adding a duplicate student or teacher).
Graceful Rollbacks:

In case of errors during database transactions, changes are rolled back to ensure data consistency.
Future Enhancements
Some potential improvements include:

User Authentication: Implement user roles (e.g., admin, teacher) for secure access.
Performance Optimization: Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
Web Interface: Expand the CLI to a web application using a framework like Flask or Django.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQLAlchemy can be used to build a robust and scalable database system for managing school operations. It uses Python for a clean and efficient ORM implementation while providing a user-friendly command-line interface for managing school data.
