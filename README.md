****End of Phase 3 Project****

##Primary School Database

This project is a primary school database management system built using ***SQLAlchemy***, a Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library. It allows management of students, teachers, classes, subjects, scores, and grades in a relational database using Python.

#Project Overview

This project simulates a school system where you can:
- Manage student data (add, view).
- Manage teacher data (add, view).
- Track student performance via scores and calculate grades.
- Organize subjects and associate them with teachers and students.
- Handle class assignments for students and teachers.


****Features****
- Student Management: Add and view student details (name, date of birth, gender, class).
- Teacher Management: Add and view teacher information and their subjects.
- Class Assignments: Organize students and teachers by class.
- Score Tracking: Manage student scores and calculate grades for subjects.
- Grade Calculation: Automatically compute and view grades for students.

****Database Schema****
- Students: Student information (name, class, etc.)
- Teachers: Teacher data and their subjects.
- Classes: Manage classes with assigned teachers and students.
- Subjects: List of subjects taught.
- Scores: Records of student scores in various subjects.
- Grades: Final grades calculated from student scores.

****Setup Instructions****
Requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- SQLAlchemy

Installation
- Clone the Repository: git clone git@github.com:WalterOnchieku/End_of_Phase3_Project--School_Database.git


Install the required dependencies:
<pip install -r requirements.txt>
Database Setup:
- The database is automatically created by SQLAlchemy when you run the project for the first time.

Run the Project:
- You can run the CLI interface by executing:<python cli.py>


****Project Structure****
- cli.py: The command-line interface that presents a menu for performing actions on the school database.
- helper.py: Contains the core logic for adding, viewing, and managing data within the database.
- models.py: The SQLAlchemy models defining the database schema, including relationships between tables.
- school.db: The SQLite database file, generated by SQLAlchemy.

***Usage***

Main Menu
- Once you run python cli.py, you will be presented with the School Database Menu where you can choose from the following options:

1. View Students
2. Add Student
3. View Teachers
4. Add Teacher
5. View Student Grades
6. View Student Scores
7. Exit

**Examples**
Add a New Student:

- Choose "Add Student" from the menu.
- Provide the requested information, such as name, date of birth, and class ID.

View All Students:

- Choose "View Students" from the menu.
- The system will display all students with their assigned classes.

View Student Grades:

- Select "View Student Grades" and provide the student's ID to display the calculated grades.

***Data Representation***

The system uses dictionaries, tuples, and lists to represent data:

Dictionary: Used to map student IDs to student data.
List of Tuples: Used to display student and teacher data with associated class and subject information.

***Error Handling***

Error handling is implemented to catch and handle various exceptions, ensuring smooth execution:

Invalid Input:

If the user enters an invalid input (e.g., a non-numeric student ID), an error message is displayed, and the program will prompt the user again.

#Database Errors:

SQLAlchemy exceptions are caught, and appropriate messages are shown when database operations fail (e.g., adding a duplicate student or teacher).
Graceful Rollbacks:

In case of errors during database transactions, changes are rolled back to ensure data consistency.

***Future Enhancements***
- User Roles: Add admin and teacher roles.
- Web Interface: Expand the CLI to a web app using Flask or Django.
